FizzBuzz Project
This project is a simple implementation of the classic FizzBuzz game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game displays numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of 3, it displays “Fizz” instead of the number and for multiples of 5, it displays “Buzz”. For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, it displays “FizzBuzz”.

Technologies Used
HTML: Used to structure the content of the web page.
CSS: Used to style the web page and make it visually appealing.
JavaScript: Used to add interactivity to the web page and implement the game logic.
In this project, I also made use of CSS Grid and Flexbox to layout the elements on the page. Grid was used to create a two-dimensional layout for the game board, while Flexbox was used to align and distribute space among items in a one-dimensional layout.

How to Play
To play the game, simply open https://annecreeyates.github.io/fizzbuzz in your web browser and press the Start button. The game will start and display the numbers from 1 to 100 according to the rules of FizzBuzz.

Enjoy!
